Welcome to Console.Blog, where I share my journey of self-discovery and technical advancement. As a mom of two and self-taught designer, I am committed to pushing the boundaries and breaking the barriers that have held me back.

While I may not have a related degree, I have always had a passion for design and technology. Over the past decade, I have honed my skills as a designer, creating promotional materials for clients and bringing their visions to life. But, I have always yearned to take my design to the next level by learning to code.

I am excited to embrace this challenge and document my progress through this blog. Through Console.Blog, I aim to provide an honest and authentic account of my journey, highlighting the challenges and the triumphs, and inspiring others to take on new challenges and pursue their dreams.

As a professional flutist with over 20 years of experience, I understand the importance of practice, dedication, and perseverance. And, I am ready to apply these principles to my pursuit of tech-savviness.

Join me on this exciting adventure, and let's push ourselves to new heights in the ever-evolving world of tech.
